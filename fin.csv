About Lynx

   Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) browser for users on
   Unix, VMS, and other platforms running cursor-addressable,
   character-cell terminals or emulators. That includes vt100 terminals,
   other character-cell displays, and vt100 emulators such as Kermit or
   Procomm running on PCs or Macs.

   For information on how to use Lynx see the Lynx User's Guide, or the
   Lynx help files.

Credits and Copyright

   Lynx was a product of the Distributed Computing Group within Academic
   Computing Services of The University of Kansas.

   Lynx was originally developed by Lou Montulli, Michael Grobe, and
   Charles Rezac. Garrett Blythe created DosLynx and later joined the Lynx
   effort as well. Following the departures of Lou and Garrett for
   positions at Netscape in the summer of 1994, Craig Lavender provided
   support services for Lynx, and Ravikumar Kolli for DosLynx.

   Lynx is maintained and supported by members of the Internet community
   coordinated via the lynx-dev mailing list.

   Lynx is derived from material copyrighted by the University of Kansas.
   However most of the release (and corresponding copyright) is the work
   of developers on the lynx-dev mailing list. It is distributed without
   restrictions on usage or redistribution under the GNU General Public
   License (Version 2).

   Lynx was built over an early version of the Common Code Library
   developed by the CERN WWW Project. That code is copyrighted by CERN.
   Lynx contains other sections of code that are copyrighted by other
   institutions or individuals. The Lynx copyright does not override or
   invalidate those copyrights.

   Thanks to Tim Berners-Lee and the other CERN World Wide Web wizards for
   the WWW client library code and all of their other work on the WWW
   project, NCSA and the Mosaic developers, and to everyone out in netland
   who has contributed to Lynx's development either directly (through
   comments or bug reports) or indirectly (through inspiration and
   development of other systems).

   Also, special thanks go to Foteos Macrides who ported much of Lynx to
   VMS and did much of its development following Lou Montulli's and
   Garrett Blythe's departures from the University of Kansas, and to Earl
   Fogel of the University of Saskatchewan. Earl implemented the hypertext
   engine HYPERREZ in the Unix environment. HYPERREZ was developed by Niel
   Larson of Think.com and served as the model for the early versions of
   Lynx which did not use the WWW libraries and had their own hypertext
   format.
